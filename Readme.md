# Tddtris

Tddtris is Tetris clone for the iPhone written in Swift. The game settings (like play area, speed), assets (images, sounds), and some implementation ideas are based on the excellent [Swiftris](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris) project and tutorial.

## Stories

While test driving this game I found it useful to define a set of user stories which gradually required the games features to be developed.

See [Stories](Stories.md) for a list and which have been completed so far.
